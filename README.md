# README file for Quantitative Neuroimaging Environment & ToolboX SDK (QuNex SDK)

This repository contains the software development kit (SDK) for the QuNex suite.
The intentions of this SDK is to provide a consistent workflow across research
teams developing the QuNex suite and to kickstart researchers interested in
integrating their own pipelines into QuNex.

The repository consists of three submodules:

* qunexaccept: acceptance tests for QuNex suite releases.
* qunexcontainer: code for building QuNex suite containers.
* qunexdevops: storage of QuNex development related code, notes and materials.

The QuNex code is co-developed and co-maintained by the:

* [Mind and Brain Lab, University of Ljubljana](https://mblab.si),
* [Cho Lab, Yale University](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/cho/).

Past contributors to the QuNex code:

* Anticevic Lab, Yale University,
* Murray Lab, Dartmouth College.
