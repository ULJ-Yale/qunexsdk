# README file for Quantitative Neuroimaging Environment & ToolboX SDK (Qu|Nex SDK)

This repository contains the software development kit (SDK) for the Qu|Nex suite.
The intentions of this SDK is to provide a consistent workflow across research
teams developing the Qu|Nex suite and to kickstart researchers interested in
integrating their own pipelines into Qu|Nex.

The repository consists of three submodules:
* qunexaccept: acceptance tests for Qu|Nex suite releases.
* qunexcontainer: code for building Qu|Nex suite containers.
* qunexdevops: storage of Qu|Nex development related code, notes and materials.

The Qu|Nex code is is co-developed and co-maintained by the 
[Mind and Brain Lab led by Grega Repovs](http://psy.ff.uni-lj.si/mblab/en) 
and the [Anticevic Lab](http://anticeviclab.yale.edu/).
